                some combination of float, position and clearfix ought to allow these two boxes to appear over top of the "article section but I can not get it working. I looked at it with Chrome Dev tools and I see that the position absolute and the width of 400 pixels I assigned is being over-ridden but i can not figure out why. I also attempted to use a zIndex to make these boxes lay over top of the others." -->
